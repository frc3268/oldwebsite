<h1>The Ballad of Bzelvis</h1>
<p>Joan was quizzical
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Bezos Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-o-o-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Bezos's Vibrating Pelvis
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Bezos's Vibrating Pelvis
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again, Bezos plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Bez to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times "I must not be so"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Bezos's Vibrating Pelvis
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Bezos's Vibrating Pelvis
Made sure that she was dead
P. C. Thirty-One
Said "We caught a dirty one"
Bezos stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free (Bezos must go free)
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Bezos's Vibrating Pelvis
Came down upon his head
Clang! Clang! Bezos's Vibrating Pelvis
Made sure that he was dead
Wo-wo-wo-woh
