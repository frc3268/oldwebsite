        <h2>So what can you do at IHS Robotics?</h2>
        <p>
          Make robots, of course! 
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lot more to it than that, though. Throughout the school year, we mainly focus on one competition, the FRC - FIRST Robotics Competition - which we spend a good chunk of time on. With that comes subfocuses such as design, electrical work, programming, and building. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of how small our group is, there's a lot of overlap - build and design go hand in hand, someone working in wiring may dip their toes in construction, and so on. That doesn't mean you can't specialize if you want to - our programmer for 2022 is the only person to have committed a significant amount to our code base.

          The pandemic hit pretty hard, and Valhallabots went through some rough years. The entirety of the 2021-2022 build season was compromised entirely of one senior and a group of freshmen, and the student-focused values of this club unfortunately meant that we had no professional mentor to guide us throughout most of the season. However, we still managed to do somewhat okay, getting in an estimated 15-20th place.

				<h2>How much time do I have to set aside for this club?</h2>
				<p>The amount of time you want to spend at the club is completely up to you. </p>
				<p>Most people will spend 1-3 hours per week in the robotics room normally (it’s a good place to hang out with friends and teammates). We’ll also host and participate in occasional events, such as one-day robot builds, though that may change due to the pandemic. </p>
				<p>During our build season — January 6 through April — students will generally spend 3-10 hours per week planning and working on the robot (during lunches, after school, and on weekends). You’ll also be expected to attend at least one competition: these are full-weekend commitments during build season. If you can't get there yourself, carpooling 
will be available.</p>
				<p>Don’t feel obligated to participate in everything we do, but do come to as much as you can and are interested in. Your participation won’t be as insignificant as in FBLA, but it’s also not as intense as a class. We’re here for fun, not drudgery! Instead of requiring you to come to every event, we seek to make you WANT to come as many as you can.</p>

				<h2>Will I be judged?</h2>
				<p>Our club is proud to be a meritocracy, where age, gender, race, and all personal characteristics are irrelevant in your participation. Ideas, in our club, are judged on their raw merit rather than their personal origin. Your ideas won’t be shouted down, and we'll approach what's best for the club in a rational manner. </p>
				<p>We understand the challenges and stigmas many people can face — especially in engineering fields — and strongly believe that your effort and skill should be more valued than anything else. This belief, above all else, will be demonstrated in the structuring and administration of this club.</p>
