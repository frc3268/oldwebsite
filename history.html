        <h2>2021-22</h2>
          <p>
           	After the pandemic happened and Robotics moved online, recruitment was spotty and 2021 had most of the Robotics club members graduate.
		  The only people with prior experience were one senior and a sophmore. The very first robotics meeting of the 2021-22 school year had
		  four people show up, the sophmore coming just to say he was going to leave.
	      </br> Thankfully, the team grew before the senior, Alpha, decided to quit, and with the help of some alumni we were back on our feet. 
	  	The Valhallabots would be able to enter FIRSTWA once more.
	      </p>
		<p>A lot had to be done to get the Valhallabots competition ready. The headquarters had to be swept of old cobwebs, a grant
			had to be requested, and some alumni had to be called in because no one knew what they were doing.</p>
		<p>Eventually, using the kit of parts and recycling some old materials, we managed to create a (somewhat) competition ready robot.
	</br>
	Our design was pretty simple - our robot would intake balls with a scoop and a conveyor belt would move the collected balls up. Unfortunately, our inexperience got the best of us
	and slow build schedule led to the flop that was our first competition, getting 31st out of 32 teams. 
	</p>
		<p>For the second competition, there was much needed reform; with that came the creation of a much-needed launching mechanism â€“ a device that
            that could actually score. This significantly improved the placement of the ValhallaBots; they had managed to get into quarterfinals with a qualifer
			of 16 out of 31.</p>
		<p>There was still much to learn from that year, as the intake mechanism did not do its job well during the competition; the ValhallaBots could shoot,
	    but they could not intake easily, which failed the "meta" [Alpha] that was the holy grail of robot success.
