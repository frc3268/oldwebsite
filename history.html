        <h2>2021-22</h2>
          <p>
            	A team of freshmen and one senior has reestablished the ValhallaBots. Amidst the pandemic chaos of the early 20's, the decision to compete 
	    has been reevaluted, with the ValhallaBots entering FIRSTWA once more.
	      </p>
		<p>Much had to be done to prepare the ValhallaBots for their glorious competitions. The headquarters had to be swept of old cobwebs, a grant by
			had to be requested, and the culmination of knowledge had to occur.</p>
		<p>Eventually, a chassis was built, and the idea of a conveyor belt was brought to the first competition. Alas, the team had not had the chance
			to test, and the ValhallaBots got 31 out of 33 place.</p>
		<p>For the second competition, there was much needed reform; with that came the creation of a much-needed launching mechanism â€“ a device that
            that could actually score. This significantly improved the placement of the ValhallaBots; they had managed to get into quarterfinals with a qualifer
			of 16 out of 31.</p>
		<p>There was still much to learn from that year, as the intake mechanism did not do its job well during the competition; the ValhallaBots could shoot,
	    but they could not intake easily, which failed the "meta" [Alpha] that was the holy grail of robot success.
