        <h2>2021-22</h2>
          <p>
           	After the pandemic happened and robotics moved online, recruitment was spotty. 2021 had most of the Robotics club members graduate, leaving less than a handful of people in the club. 
		  The only people with prior experience were one senior and a sophmore, and very first robotics meeting of the 2021-22 school year had
		  four people show up. The sophmore came in just to say he was going to leave.
	      </br> Thankfully, the team grew before the only remaining club member, Alpha, decided to quit, and with the help of some alumni we were back on our feet. 
	  	We remain a club one more year.
	      </p>
		<p>A lot had to be done to get the Valhallabots competition ready. We had to figure out our little robotics area, get money for the competition, and some alumni had to be called in because no one knew what they were doing.</p>
		<p>With grant money from the school district coming in to waive the hefty $10,000 needed for FRC, we would be able to actually do the competition!
			Eventually, using the kit of parts and recycling some old materials, we even managed to create a (somewhat) competition ready robot.
	</br>
	Our first design was pretty simple - our robot would intake balls with a scoop and a conveyor belt would move the collected balls up. Unfortunately, our inexperience got the best of us
	and slow build schedule led to the flop that was our first competition, where we had to remove our intake because it was over the frame and duct-tape on addons while we were loading in and out of the field.
	We ended up getting <a href = 'https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2022wasno'>31st out of 33 teams</a> and never got a single ball into the goal. 
	</p>
		<p>For the second competition, we had to take our old design and scrap most of it, building an intake by cutting a section of our frame out
			and using an intake wheel to roll the balls in. Then, we'd shoot them out of a fast spinning launch wheel that got the ball to go higher 
			than nine feet when needed. Next competition, By entering in as a backup, we even got to the qualifiers (but our alliance lost too many matches). 
			However, our score significantly improved, <a href = 'https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2022wabon'going from 31st to 16th!</a> If we continue at that rate, we'll be 1st next competition, then -14th after that!
		<p>We've improved a lot and could definitely have done a lot better, but we'll have to wait for next year to get a better shot.
